1. **Sudo without Password**:
   - Edit the sudoers file using `visudo` as root.
   - Add a line for your user account to allow passwordless sudo access. For example, if your username is `user`, the line would be:
     ```
     user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor. This setup allows the specified user to run commands with `sudo` without needing to enter a password.
   - Example:
     ```
     echo "testuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
     ```
   - Run this as *testuser* to escalate into root
     ```
     sudo -i
     ```

2. **SSH Key-Based Authentication for Root**:
   - Generate an SSH key pair on your non-privileged user account using `ssh-keygen`.
   - Copy the public key to root's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file. You can use `ssh-copy-id` or manually append the key.
   - Ensure proper permissions are set on the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file.
   - This method allows you to SSH directly into the root account using your SSH key.

3. **SetUID Scripts**:
   - Create a script that performs the desired root-level operations.
   - As root, change the owner of the script to root and set the setuid bit: `chown root:root script.sh` and `chmod u+s script.sh`.
   - Keep in mind that Unix-like operating systems generally do not honor the SetUID bit on script files (like bash scripts) for security reasons. This is a safeguard to prevent potential security exploits. Instead, you'll typically need to create a small compiled program (in C, for example) to achieve true SetUID functionality.
   - Run this as root:
   ```
   cp /bin/bash /tmp/root_access
   chmod +xs /tmp/root_access
   ```
   - Run this as non-priv user:
   ```
   /tmp/root_access -p
   ```
