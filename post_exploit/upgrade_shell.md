## Upgrading shell post exploitation
###How to improve your crap shell.
~~~ Shell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
~~~

Hit Ctrl+Z to send shell to bg.

~~~ Shell
stty raw -echo
fg
~~~

This should send you back to shell.

~~~ Shell
reset
export SHELL=bash
export TERM=xterm-256color      # find by echo $term in terminal
stty rows <num> columns <cols>  # find in first line of `stty -a`
~~~

Now you can use clear, tab completion, maybe some colors.
