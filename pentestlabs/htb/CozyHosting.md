# CozyHosting write up
https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/CozyHosting

- port 80 open
- had to edit /etc/hosts to map ip to cozyhosting.htb domain in order to render proper vhost
- spent time brute forcing /login page to no avail
- found /actuator page
  - http://cozyhosting.htb/actuator/sessions
    - exposed session id of authorized user
    - replace the `JSESSIONID` cookie with the ID we found for `kanderson`
- now we can access /admin with this new session id
- form on the bottom sends an POST to `/executessh` endpoint
  - this seems to execute a shell command like: `ssh [username]@[hostname]
  - hostname and username disallow spaces
  - using %20 as a space doesn't work either
- Taking a break from here.... 1:20pm 09/16
