unzip `Sequence 01.zip`

there are two files 
- an mp3
- a docx that's password protected

I listened the mp3. It's stairway to heaven and I left it playing. Heard some weird glitches during parts of the song.

Opened it up in Sonic Virtualizer. Add Spectographic layer and found this:

`Gr33dK1Lzz@11Wh0Per5u3`

It took me a while to figureout what was wrong, because I couldn't crack it. Turned out I left the `P` lower case. Bleh.

The flag is supposed to be the name of an executable. 

Once you open the docx w/ the password. The exectable filename is written in the document. It's not embedded as a macro or anyting like that.
